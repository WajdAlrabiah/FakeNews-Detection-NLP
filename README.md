# FakeNews-Detection-NLP

This repository implements a **Fake News Detection** system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models in Python. The project focuses on preprocessing text data, extracting TF-IDF features, and classifying news articles as **real** or **fake**. Multiple classifiers are used, including SVM, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and an ensemble Voting classifier.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing:
  - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, URL removal, lemmatization
  - Stopwords removal
- Visualization:
  - Word clouds for fake and real news
  - Count plots and confusion matrices
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
- Classification models:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Ensemble Voting Classifier (soft voting)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
